# Natural-Language-Processing
> Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

This repository contains two projects from my [NLP](https://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~elhadad/nlp21.html) course.\
The first project covers 3 parts:
1. **Language Models**: developed a language model over two distinct datasets (using n-gram models). 
2. **probabilistic model and regularization**: addressed the learning task example (regression) - polynomial curve fitting formulated in a probabilistic framework.
3. **Text classifications**: I adopt the [Character RNN for classification](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/char_rnn_classification_tutorial.html) to a different dataset.
